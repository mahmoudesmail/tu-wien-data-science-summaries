\section{Introduction} % introduction / general conditions / motivation: which user group / research question do you want to find a solution for. you can define this freely, but you should motivate why the topic is relevant.

% why this is relevant

Effective visualization of temporal graphs can reveal valuable insights such as patterns, trends, and anomalies that might otherwise remain hidden in raw data. This allows researchers, analysts, and decision-makers to quickly grasp evolving relationships, identify critical points of change, and make data-driven decisions.

In the context of global warming, multi-temporal scale visualizations of carbon emissions data can provide valuable insights for decision-makers, as demonstrated by Ma et al. \cite{ma2023histgnn}. In logistics, these visualizations can help optimize supply chain operations and identify inefficiencies \cite{Yang2019AnimatedMS} \cite{Tamilmani2019ModellingAA}. For social networks, they can illuminate user interactions and information spread. In public policy, temporal graph visualizations can aid in tracking disease spread, monitoring resource allocation and analyzing policy impacts \cite{chung2023temporal}.
These examples demonstrate how temporal graph visualizations compress temporal network data into intuitive representations. And as the volume and complexity of temporal data continue to grow across various domains, the development and application of effective visualization techniques for temporal graphs will likely become increasingly important.

\medskip

% definitions

As a practical example this paper explores various techniques for interactive visualization of time-dependent and bipartite graphs, using the ``Media Transparency Database Austria'' \cite{dataset}.

\textbf{Time-dependent} graphs or temporal graphs are structures that evolve over time, with nodes and edges changing as time progresses. These graphs are crucial for representing dynamic systems and processes that unfold chronologically. They allow us to observe patterns, trends, and changes in relationships between entities over different time periods \cite{Waldner2020InteractiveEO}.
One specific type of temporal graph that has gained prominence is the bipartite graph. \textbf{Bipartite} graphs or bigraphs consist of two distinct sets of nodes, with connections only existing between nodes from different sets, but not within the same set. If the two subsets have equal cardinality (balanced bigraph) and each node in one subset is connected to every node in the other subset, the graph is called a complete bigraph \cite{diestel2012graph}. These graphs are particularly useful for modeling relationships between two different types of entities, such as public authorities and their advertising expenditures.
Due to their scale and complexity, time-dependent and bipartite graphs can be challenging to visualize effectively. To make sense of the Media Transparency Database Austria, which contains thousands of entries over multiple years, we need to design scalable and \textbf{interactive visualizations} that allow users to explore the data, for example, by filtering, zooming, and selecting specific time periods or entities.

The ``Media Transparency Database Austria'' \cite{dataset} is a public repository that records the advertising expenses of public authorities in Austria. This database serves as a tool for transparency (based on the Austrian § 34 Transparenzdatenbankgesetz 2012 TDBG), allowing citizens and researchers to track how public funds are spent on advertising across various media outlets. It provides a rich dataset that can be represented as both a time-dependent and bipartite graph structure. By visualizing this data \textendash{} although not the focus of this paper \textendash{} we can gain insights into how public authorities allocate advertising budgets, which media outlets receive the most / least funding, how both the political and media landscapes evolve over time and mutually influence each other.

\medskip

% goal

This paper aims to combine state-of-the-art techniques and approaches for designing interactive visualizations of time-dependent and bipartite graphs to propose a final design for the ``Media Transparency Database Austria''. We will focus on clear, uncluttered overviews while maximizing information content and propose a design that allows users to interact with the data intuitively. Additionally, we will consider how our proposed visualization could be evaluated and what results we expect to achieve.




\section{Related Work} % which solutions exist, what are their strengths and weaknesses, how suitable are they for the data characteristics of the Media Transparency Database


% Existing visualization methods often struggle with large-scale, temporal bipartite data. Our research aims to address these limitations through:

% 1. Scalable visualization techniques for large datasets
% 2. Hierarchical aggregation and clustering methods
% 3. Intuitive user interface design
% 4. Integration of time series visualization

% The goal is to create accessible, insightful visualizations  will contribute to information visualization research and provide tools for analyzing public spending on advertising in Austria.

%% \section{Introduction} %for journal use above \firstsection{..} instead
% This template is for papers of VGTC-sponsored conferences which are \emph{\textbf{not}} published in a special issue of TVCG.

% \section{Using This Template}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item If you receive compilation errors along the lines of ``\texttt{Package ifpdf Error: Name clash, \textbackslash ifpdf is already defined}'' then please add a new line ``\texttt{\textbackslash let\textbackslash ifpdf\textbackslash relax}'' right after the ``\texttt{\textbackslash documentclass[journal]\{vgtc\}}'' call. Note that your error is due to packages you use that define ``\texttt{\textbackslash ifpdf}'' which is obsolete (the result is that \texttt{\textbackslash ifpdf} is defined twice); these packages should be changed to use ifpdf package instead.
% \item The style uses the hyperref package, thus turns references into internal links. We thus recommend to make use of the ``\texttt{\textbackslash cref\{reference\}}'' call (instead of ``\texttt{Figure\~{}\textbackslash ref\{reference\}}'' or similar) since ``\texttt{\textbackslash cref\{reference\}}'' turns the entire reference into an internal link, not just the number. Examples: \cref{fig:vis_papers} and \cref{tab:vis_papers}.
% \item The style automatically looks for image files with the correct extension (eps for regular \LaTeX; pdf, png, and jpg for pdf\LaTeX), in a set of given subfolders (figures/, pictures/, images/). It is thus sufficient to use ``\texttt{\textbackslash includegraphics\{CypressView\}}'' (instead of ``\texttt{\textbackslash includegraphics\{pictures/CypressView.jpg\}}'').
% \item For adding hyperlinks and DOIs to the list of references, you can use ``\texttt{\textbackslash bibliographystyle\{abbrv-doi-hyperref-narrow\}}'' (instead of ``\texttt{\textbackslash bibliographystyle\{abbrv\}}''). It uses the doi and url fields in a bib\TeX\ entry and turns the entire reference into a link, giving priority to the doi. The doi can be entered with or without the ``\texttt{http://dx.doi.org/}'' url part. See the examples in the bib\TeX\ file and the bibliography at the end of this template.\\[1em]
% \textbf{Note 1:} occasionally (for some \LaTeX\ distributions) this hyper-linked bib\TeX\ style may lead to \textbf{compilation errors} (``\texttt{pdfendlink ended up in different nesting level ...}'') if a reference entry is broken across two pages (due to a bug in hyperref). In this case make sure you have the latest version of the hyperref package (i.\,e., update your \LaTeX\ installation/packages) or, alternatively, revert back to ``\texttt{\textbackslash bibliographystyle\{abbrv-doi-narrow\}}'' (at the expense of removing hyperlinks from the bibliography) and try ``\texttt{\textbackslash bibliographystyle\{abbrv-doi-hyperref-narrow\}}'' again after some more editing.\\[1em]
% \textbf{Note 2:} the ``\texttt{-narrow}'' versions of the bibliography style use the font ``PTSansNarrow-TLF'' for typesetting the DOIs in a compact way. This font needs to be available on your \LaTeX\ system. It is part of the \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/paratype}{``paratype'' package}, and many distributions (such as MikTeX) have it automatically installed. If you do not have this package yet and want to use a ``\texttt{-narrow}'' bibliography style then use your \LaTeX\ system's package installer to add it. If this is not possible you can also revert to the respective bibliography styles without the ``\texttt{-narrow}'' in the file name.\\[1em]
% DVI-based processes to compile the template apparently cannot handle the different font so, by default, the template file uses the \texttt{abbrv-doi} bibliography style but the compiled PDF shows you the effect of the \texttt{abbrv-doi-hyperref-narrow} style.
% \end{itemize}

% \section{Bibliography Instructions}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Sort all bibliographic entries alphabetically but the last name of the first author. This \LaTeX/bib\TeX\ template takes care of this sorting automatically.
% \item Merge multiple references into one; e.\,g., use \cite{Kitware:2003,Max:1995:OMF} (not \cite{Kitware:2003}\cite{Max:1995:OMF}). Within each set of multiple references, the references should be sorted in ascending order. This \LaTeX/bib\TeX\ template takes care of both the merging and the sorting automatically.
% \item Verify all data obtained from digital libraries, even ACM's DL and IEEE Xplore  etc.\ are sometimes wrong or incomplete.
% \item Do not trust bibliographic data from other services such as Mendeley.com, Google Scholar, or similar; these are even more likely to be incorrect or incomplete.
% \item Articles in journal---items to include:
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item author names
% 	\item title
% 	\item journal name
% 	\item year
% 	\item volume
% 	\item number
% 	\item month of publication as variable name (i.\,e., \{jan\} for January, etc.; month ranges using \{jan \#\{/\}\# feb\} or \{jan \#\{-{}-\}\# feb\})
%   \end{itemize}
% \item use journal names in proper style: correct: ``IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'', incorrect: ``Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on''
% \item Papers in proceedings---items to include:
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item author names
% 	\item title
% 	\item abbreviated proceedings name: e.\,g., ``Proc.\textbackslash{} CONF\_ACRONYNM'' without the year; example: ``Proc.\textbackslash{} CHI'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} 3DUI'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} Eurographics'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} EuroVis''
% 	\item year
% 	\item publisher
% 	\item town with country of publisher (the town can be abbreviated for well-known towns such as New York or Berlin)
%   \end{itemize}
% \item article/paper title convention: refrain from using curly brackets, except for acronyms/proper names/words following dashes/question marks etc.; example:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item paper ``Marching Cubes: A High Resolution 3D Surface Construction Algorithm''
% 	\item should be entered as ``\{M\}arching \{C\}ubes: A High Resolution \{3D\} Surface Construction Algorithm'' or  ``\{M\}arching \{C\}ubes: A high resolution \{3D\} surface construction algorithm''
% 	\item will be typeset as ``Marching Cubes: A high resolution 3D surface construction algorithm''
% \end{itemize}
% \item for all entries
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item DOI can be entered in the DOI field as plain DOI number or as DOI url; alternative: a url in the URL field
% 	\item provide full page ranges AA-{}-BB
% \end{itemize}
% \item when citing references, do not use the reference as a sentence object; e.\,g., wrong: ``In \cite{Lorensen:1987:MCA} the authors describe \dots'', correct: ``Lorensen and Cline \cite{Lorensen:1987:MCA} describe \dots''
% \end{itemize}
